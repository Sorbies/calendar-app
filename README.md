## About the Project

We want to create a calendar application that focuses on organization and productivity. It would allow users to customize daily/weekly to-do lists, reminders, notes, events on a calendar, and set alarms/timers/stopwatches. The main focus for our app will be categorization, customization, and overall a clean user interface. 

Our motivation for this application is to provide users a place where they can leave the burden of remembering their tasks and give them a space to be organized. As of now, we feel that there is not an application where users have access to a lot of organization tools and resources in which they can add personalizations to their tasks, events, and more. In addition, in programming our own productivity app, we are aiming to solve problems we encounter from using other productivity apps. For example, it is unintuitive to create separate categories of calendars in Google Calendar, and time sensitive tasks that are yet to be completed are not easily visible on Apple Calendar. Also, the way you can customize when events repeat is somewhat limited; for example, you canâ€™t set an event to repeat every 9 days or on the first three Wednesdays of every month.
